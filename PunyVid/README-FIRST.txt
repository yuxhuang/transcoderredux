This is the source code for an simple iPod video converter program called PunyVid. It may look strangely familiar to you.
It's a new program with a new name, ready for others to give it a new life.

...but it was originally written three years ago without any previous programming experience. Ill-thought-out brute-force combinations of AppleScript and bash scripting are everywhere. It would probably be best described at what NOT to do. Kind of a lost cause. Think of it more as a comedy...or tragedy.

Additional things needed:
ffmpeg around SVN r6213. Parsing would need to be updated for anything else. See "movenc-r6213.diff" for the iPod atom code patch and some complimentary bugs.
svn -r 6213 checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg
