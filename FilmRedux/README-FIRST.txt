This is the source code for a video converter program called FilmRedux.
It's a new program, ready for others to give it a new life.

It's unfinished, unpolished, and includes latent code from another project, but a lot of the core is in place. iTunes-compatible conversions mostly work, and 80% of the UI is working. Intentions are there, it just needs some TLC from smarter people.

From an educational standpoint, there are probably some really neat AppleScript Studio things done here (and probably some really dumb things done here too). Insight is free for all.

Additional things needed (so far):

mediainfo - http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net
